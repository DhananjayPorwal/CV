A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an
assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine
used, and the provisional certificate also provides the next
vaccination due. It also is an evidence for the beneficiary to prove
to any entities which may require proof of vaccination specially in
case of travel. Vaccination not only protects individuals from
disease, but also reduces their risk of spreading the virus.
Therefore, there could be a requirement in future to produce
certificate for certain kind of social interactions and international
travel.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">
In this context the certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in
